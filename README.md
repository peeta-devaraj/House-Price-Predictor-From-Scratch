# 🏗️ House Price Predictor – Linear Regression from Scratch 🧠📈

This project is a deep dive into **building Linear Regression without using any ML libraries** like `scikit-learn`. I wrote the algorithm from scratch using only Python and core mathematical logic.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 🧮 Implemented cost function and gradient descent manually
- 🧠 Trained a model to predict house prices
- 🛠️ No ML libraries used – just Python, NumPy, and math
- 📈 Bridged theoretical math with real-world application

## 📌 Why Build from Scratch?

While libraries make life easier, they often abstract away the learning. I wanted to truly understand:

- How the cost function minimizes error
- What happens behind `.fit()` and `.predict()`
- How models learn from data step-by-step

## 📊 Dataset Used

A sample housing dataset with features like area, bedrooms, and price (manually created / synthetic for demo purposes).

> 📁 You can run the notebook directly to see how the model performs on this data.

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Confidence in manual ML implementation
- Intuition on optimization & convergence
- The power of building ML logic without black boxes



## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- NumPy 🧮
- Matplotlib (for visualization) 📊

## 🏁 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/House-Price-Predictor-From-Scratch.git
